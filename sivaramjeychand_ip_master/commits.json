Added the delete function in this commit as well, as it was just one extra method, and I was already using ArrayList to store tasks from the very beginning. Rewrote and shuffled around code in the main class to handle all the various exceptions. With how late I started this I am happy with my progress. I should add more flavour and personality in the upcoming weeks.\n","tags":["level-6","level-5"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":147,"deletions":38}}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"sivaramjeychand":{"java":275,"md":0,"fxml":0,"sh":0,"bat":0,"gradle":0,"txt":0}},"authorContributionVariance":{"sivaramjeychand":9335.689},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"sivaramjeychand":"CS2103T-T08-1 SARA..HAND"}}
