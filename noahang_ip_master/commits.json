SirDuke.start() method, add Echo functionality, fix style, remove logo","messageBody":"-SirDuke.start() method created to contain welcome message printing and user input reading from console\n\n-SirDuke.start() method also contains Echo functionality, and calls SirDuke.sayBye() when \"bye\" command is received\n\n-horizontalLine variable is a constant, so it\u0027s variable name has been changed to HORIZONTAL_LINE\n-print messages have been updated to follow style guide for split strings\n-logo variable has been removed as it is no longer

Task.java, ToDoList.java, Format.java SirDuke.java: Move printing of commands to ToDoList class, add switch statement for command execution","messageBody":"Each task is as string.\n\nStrings cannot encapsulate whether the task was completed or not.\n\nLet\u0027s create a Task class, Task.java to encapsulate the task name and completion status.\nLet\u0027s create a method to get the name of the Task as a String.\n\nThis will help us add other properties of Tasks in future versions (like deadlines)\n\nThere is no data structure to store Tasks.\n\nTasks need to be stored and list needs to be displayed.\n\nLet\u0027s create a ToDoList class, ToDoList.java, that contains a HashMap(with variable name toDoList) with task index as the key and the Task as the value.\nLet\u0027s create a method to add a Task to the list when a String is provided.\nLet\u0027s create a method to display the index and name of all Tasks in the Hashmap.\n\nThis allows us to add other functionalities of the ToDoList in future versions (like deletion of tasks)\n\nSirDuke class prints all commands received.\n\nSirDuke class receives, executes and implements the execution of each command, and this complicates\nthe function of the SirDuke class.\n\nLet\u0027s create a switch statement to call the appropriate method based on the given command.\nLet\u0027s remove unnceccessary print statements.\n\nWe create a switch statement to make it easy to add code for other commands to be handled by the SirDuke class in future versions.\nWe move implementation of execution of commands to the ToDoList class so that SirDuke class only has to receive command\nand decide the corresponding action to take, this categorises the functions of each class and makes it easier to know where to\nwrite code when writing features in future versions.\n\nHORIZONTAL_LINE is common across multiple classes.\n\nWe have to create a HORIZONTAL_LINE every time we intend to use it in a class.\n\nLet\u0027s create a Format class, Format.java that contains all objects we intend to use for formatting printed output.\n\nThis allows us to add other formatting objects and use them across all classes that need them without having to re-define them\nevery time we need to use them.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":81,"deletions":16}}},{"hash":"0b3411ec2465ef89265e04c30b1ff5de265ebd16","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Revert \"Add Task.java,

toDoList which is a HashMap data structure, into an ArrayList data structure, standardise indexing to start from 0 in ToDoList.java toDoList, add remove function in SirDuke.java and error handling for invalid inputs","messageBody":"ToDoList.java:\n- The previous commit had already replaced the HashMap with an ArrayList, we now ensure that the user can refer to a task by it\u0027s index starting from 1, and the SirDuke.java class will translate it to the index to start from 0, so that the ToDoList class can operate on the indexes of items as starting from 0\n- ArrayList instead of HashMap is preferred, so that when a Task is removed from the ToDoList, the Tasks below it will automatically move up an index in the underlying ArrayList data structure and hence in the ToDoList, this moving up of indexes would be alot harder to implement if we continue to use a HashMap\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":28,"deletions":9}}},{"hash":"b064e16fca39706983634160ca16de0b0422dd3b","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"rename removeTask() method
