codebase to adhere to OOP principles","messageBody":"Refactor the codebase to improve modularity, maintainability, and adherence to OOP principles.\n\nKey changes:\n- Extracted closely related code into separate classes:\n  - `Ui`: Handles all user interactions.\n  - `Storage`: Manages loading and saving tasks to/from a file.\n  - `Parser`: Parses user commands and returns appropriate `Command` objects.\n  - `TaskList`: Manages the list of tasks (e.g., adding, deleting, marking tasks).\n- Introduced the `Command` interface and implemented command classes (e.g., `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, `ExitCommand`) to encapsulate the logic for each user command.\n- Simplified the `Einstein` class to delegate responsibilities to the extracted classes, improving readability and maintainability.\n\nBenefits of this refactoring:\n1. **Modularity**: Each class has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and extend.\n2. **Reusability**: Common functionality (e.g., parsing dates, saving tasks) is centralized and reusable.\n3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one part of the code (e.g., command logic) are isolated and less likely to affect other parts.\n4.
