This ensures that the tasks are persisted between sessions.\n- **Load tasks from disk**: The tasks are loaded from the hard disk when the chatbot starts up. This allows the chatbot to resume from where it left off.\n- **File path handling**: The file paths are specified using relative paths and in an OS-independent way to ensure compatibility across different operating systems.\n- **Folder and file creation**: The code handles the case where the data file or the required folder does not exist at the start. This ensures that the chatbot can be run on a new computer without issues.\n- **Data file corruption handling**: The code includes basic handling for the situation where the data file is corrupted (i.e., content not in the expected format) by throwing IO errors.\n\nAdditionally, the project structure has been restructured to better organize the code and resources.\n\nExample of the data file format as given in the task requirements:\nT | 1 | read book\nD | 0 | return book | June 6th\nE | 0 | project meeting | Aug 6th 2-4pm\nT | 1 | join sports club\n\nThis change improves the stability and usability of the application by ensuring that tasks are persisted and loaded correctly.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":0,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":443,"deletions":187}}},{"hash":"f80d4e526c4e0b1b711008d4d76a232f9e833316","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-level-7\u0027 Merge branch \u0027branch-Level-7\u0027 into master","messageBody":"This merge integrates the changes from `branch-Level-7` into the `master` branch.
