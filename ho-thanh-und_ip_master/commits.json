Changing the type to Task helped fix the bug\n","tags":["Level-4"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":56,"deletions":3}}},{"hash":"4339cc84a472f9ef5fb63c9ac024e9fadbdbf450","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"- Added 3 child classes of Task.java to enhance variety of tasks to todos, deadlines and events","messageBody":"Mistakes occurred:\n- Lots of repetition with these if-else blocks.
